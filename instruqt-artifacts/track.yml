title: Reduce unplanned maintenance with Kernel live patching
teaser: Resolve critical vulnerabilities and exposures by applying kernel live patches
  to systems without taking downtime for maintenance.
description: |
  # Goal:
  After completing this lab, users will be able to apply a Kernel Live Patch to
  a system, resolving a security vulnerability without rebooting into an updated
  kernel.

  # Concepts included in this lab:

  * Install Kernel Live Patching software and service
  * Deploy a Kernel Live Patch on a running system
  * Verify status of a Kernel Live Patch
  * Methodology to locate details and information for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) published by Red Hat

  # Example Usecase:

  To provide an alternative to emergency kernel maintenance events for
  the mitigation of Critical kernel CVEs.  It is expected that after an
  organization has live patched a running kernel that they will, at some point,
  schedule a maintenance window to apply the updated kernel package to the
  system and perform a system reboot.  Kernel Live Patching allows the
  organization to determine when this window occurs rather than the release of
  a fix for a Critical CVE.
